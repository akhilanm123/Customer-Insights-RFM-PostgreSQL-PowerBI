# Customer-Insights-RFM-PostgreSQL-PowerBI
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze customer purchasing behavior and segment them based on their transaction history. By leveraging RFM analysis, I identified high-value customers, at-risk customers, and potential churners. This insight enables businesses to enhance customer retention strategies, optimize marketing efforts, and boost overall revenue.
### Key Business Questions Answered
 - Who are our most valuable customers?
- Which customer segments contribute the most revenue?
- What is the churn rate, and how does it impact revenue?
- How can we retain customers and increase repeat purchases
### Dataset Used

## Technical Approach
### 1. Data Handling & Storage
- **Database**: Used **PostgreSQL** to store and manage customer transaction data efficiently.
- **Data Cleaning**: Performed **NULL handling**, **duplicate removal**, and **standardization** in **SQL**.
-  SQL Queries used:  <a href="https://github.com/akhilanm123/Customer-Insights-RFM-PostgreSQL-PowerBI/blob/main/SQL%20QUERIES.docx">SQL Queries_Word file</a>
 ### 2. RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation
- **Recency (R)** → Days since the last purchase
- **Frequency (F)** → Number of transactions per customer
- **Monetary (M)** → Total revenue generated by each customer
- **Assigned RFM scores** and categorized customers into **Loyal, VIP, Regular**, and **At-Risk segments**.
